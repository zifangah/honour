2-D interface
A GeoGebra (ggb) applet can be referenced via either material ID or ggbBase64 code in an html page. A .ggb file can be stored as a registered GeoGebra user’s material on the web-based platform, the specific material ID can be found in its URL usually in the format \{www.geogebra.org/m/materialID\}. It takes a few steps to obtain the ggbBase64 code of a ggb file. When the file is open and running in GeoGebra’s desktop application, press ctrl + shift + B, paste to a text file. A lengthy code sequence representing the ggb file on base 64 format shows up, it can be used in reference to that particular file. Notice a .ggb file can be recovered by first converting the ggbBase64 code to a .bin file, then converting .bin to .ggb in the file extension. In most part of the implementation, ggbBase64 code is the preferred choice to build GGBApplet in the script due to its consistency in successfully building the referenced applet. Material ID sometimes is hardly in use since it did not show up on the interface for reasons that need further investigation. Multiple applets are injected via scripting once the web window onloads. Console writes a welcome message.
	Any change in a point’s behaviour is captured through a registerObjectUpdateListener, a mapped function that consists a series of events gets triggered, passing the change in value to another applet. Therefore further change is computed and reflected in another applet. For example, the operators’ computation formula involves subdifferential, inverse of subdifferential and conjugate. An interface with four applets can be achieved using a table in HTML.
	\subsection{3D GeoGebra application}
	A PL convex function in 3-D is constructed in GeoGebra application instead of a web-based environment, mostly due to the high demand on graphic card performance in an additional dimension. The mapping of function value to sub-gradient vector is set on object properties in the application. The same method applies to the mapping of $\dom f: x $ to function value $f(x)$, that of $\dom f^*: s$ subdifferential to $f^{*} (s)$ conjugate. 
	Piecewise functions are plotted using conditional function command in GeoGebra when in use.
