Part I) 2-D interface
1. open folder 2D-v2_Main result
2. open Main result_PL_5 points_piecewise constant subdifferential.html
with Google chrome, firefox, or IE browser
3. zoom in/out on each applet to such that they have the same scaling
to match the scaling standard (see scalingStand.pdf)
4. move sampled points to form a convex function on green graph to see changes in the rest of the applets
[5*. click view pagesource for detailed codes]

Part II) 3-D GeoGebra application
1. Download GeoGebra application from https://www.geogebra.org/download
GeoGebra 5 and above works for the application.
2. open folder named 3D_Main result, 
oepn PL-v2_main result.ggb with GeoGebra app
3. Move any of points A-E on the domain plane (blue) to see changes
in colour-coded subgradient (orange) plane, in conjugates linked the the subgradient
vertically
[4*. Click view -> spreedsheet to check how domain is changing function value
click view ->  CAS to check how subgradient vector is computed]

Part III) 2-D interface development working examples
open GeoGebra scripting_demo folder
go over each example by its numerical order
[]: are instructions formore thorough understanding of the tools
