~~~part 1 PLQ 2D 5 points
This html page shows Geogebra Applet to Applet communication
a piecewise linear function in 2D,(sub)derivative 
inverse of the sub-derivative, the conjugates, 

~~~when a point is moved,
the corresponding derivative changes dynamically, 
you will notice the same for the inverse,and the conjugate
~~~
when a (sub)-derivative is moved, 
a piece-wise quadratic function pass through the two points, 
smoothen the pw function
~~~part 2 PLQ 3D
this is a piecewise convex function in 3D, 
each plane has a gradient vector in the centre;
the slope of the plane changes the gradient;
user can manipulate the domain of the function on the blue plane;
~~~
each of the sub-gradient is mapped on the orange plane,
it changes its location when the plane is changed;
~~~
these subgradient is mapped to its respective conjugate
conjugate changes dynamically with user input from the domain as well
