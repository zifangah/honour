~~~part 1 PLQ 2D 5 points
This html page shows Geogebra Applet to 
Applet communication
applet 1 the green part:is a piecewise
function close to f(x)=1/2 x^2 set by default
applet 2 the red part: are the
derivative of above points 
using forward subgradient
of any two adjacent points
applet 4 the orange part: is the
inverse of the derivative
applet 3 the violet part represents
the conjugates, the change in function
value with a different gradient
meanwhile the inverse of derivative 
and conjugate change accordingly 
~~~when a point is moved in applet 1,
the corresponding derivative changes
dynamically in applet 2, you will notice
the same for the inverse in applet 4,
as well as the conjugate in applet 3
~~~
when a derivative is moved, a piece-wise
linear quadratic qunction pass through
the two points responsible, the surface
begin to smooth out with 
a bit of fiddling
~~~part 2 PLQ 3D
the red, green, yellow, light blue 
are piecewise planes, each with a 
vector in the centre representing
subsequent gradient
when a defining point on the plane 
changes its location, its gradient
vector changes accordingly
